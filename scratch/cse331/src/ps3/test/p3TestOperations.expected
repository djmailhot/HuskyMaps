# Operations testing that checks the functionality of AddNode, AddEdge,
# and their related observers.  Also, tests that unrelated graphs or 
# unconnected nodes do not effect path finding outcomes.  Finally, makes 
# sure that the abstraction invariant holds (no duplicate edges).

# create generic nodes
created node f1 with cost 1
created node f2 with cost 2
created node d5 with cost 5
created node e1 with cost 1
created graph G
created graph H

# test the separation of graphs

H contains: 
added node f1 to H
added node f2 to H

# test adding edges

# test pathfinding is different between graphs
